    "## Before we get started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is Python? Why should we learn Python?** Python is a programming language. A programming language lets us \"talk\" to computers and robots easily. Python is easier than many other languages for beginners as it uses syntax that sounds like English. However, that does not mean Python is less useful: it is one of the most popular languages in the world, and is used in data analysis, finance, physics, design, game development, and helping you do things on your computer faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How will learning Python be different from block-based coding?** The obvious difference is you have to type commands, rather than just moving blocks. Even a single typo can lead to many errors, especially if you are not yet used to typing a lot. *This is normal!* Even very experienced programmers spend a lot of time fixing errors. So why don't we just use block-based coding? Well, Python is much more flexible and powerful. Eventually, you will be able to use Python not just to move robots, but also to create complex games, visual art, AI chatbots, and more. You can't do that with UCode.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tools for coding in Python.** For now, we will use Jupyter notebook. Later on, once you have mastered using functions, we will switch to VS Code. Jupyter notebook and VS Code are called *integrated development environments (IDEs)*. They help you code and find mistakes faster than writing in a simple text editor like Notepad.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Homework.** This term, you will have short exercises to do at home. You must complete these to keep up with the class. They will not take more than one hour per week. In some cases, they might be too difficult for you to complete in an hour. This is fine, but you should still try for the full hour before giving up. The process of struggling has been proven to help us learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **A note on the content.** While we try to make the lessons engaging, you need to learn the basic syntax of Python to be able to create more complex and interesting programs. This is like mathematics: you have to learn to count, memorise times tables, and be able to add numbers before you can do geometry or calculus. Just like mathematics, you will need time and repeated practice to get better at coding. Have some patience; it will pay off in the end."
